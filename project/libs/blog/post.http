  "textContent": "Absolutely all great civilizations leave prophecies and prescriptions to their descendants. Maya, as one of the most famous ancient ones, was no exception. Surprisingly, the Maya predicted many dates on which many important events for humanity were to take place. If great human minds have correctly deciphered the prophecies of the Maya, then people should meet the New Era on their way. But there is a fear that a New Era will come along with many natural disasters that will affect the whole world."
